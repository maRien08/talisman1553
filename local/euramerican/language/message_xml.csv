(above level 55)

Seven Stars Stage is inside a cave which is between Dai's Field and Loo's Village. This cave looks like a big fish externally, so it enjoys the reputation of 'Ichthyoid Cave'. Although it seems quite normally like other caves around, unknown mystery and danger are approaching here step by step. Since the sharp conflict between Loo's Village and Dai's Field, a lot of powerful characters have gathered here.  Another bad news is that the people of Loo's Village have built a Star Tower for Golden Star Tao Guo to help him cope with the justicial heroes with his enhancement.  So the most urgent thing for you is to enter Ichthyoid Cave Seven Stars Stage and eliminate Golden Star Tao Guo!!

With the hidden evil purpose of breeding the Super Battle Spider which achieves worldwide notoriety as 'King of Poison', Golden Star Tao Guo has asked Loo's Villagers to build Sever Stars Stage for him to make enchantment.  Many years ago, Guo has captured both Iron Scorpion and Flame Spider which are necessaries for fostering the Spider.  Although the born Super Battle Spider has come into shape after years of breeding, it's still in a state of dormancy because it lacks the evil's breath for its ability to expose to the outside world.  When Guo was invited by Loo's Villager to help, he took the chance to examine the Ichthyoid Cave and found that the bottom of this cave can provide the needed evil's breath, so he accepted their request immediately and took the lead of Loo's Villagers to build the Seven Stars Stage, and by means of Seven Stars Stage's geographical advantage, exploit an independent area at the bottom of Ichthyoid Cave which is called Spider Catacomb.  Guo especially asked his henchman Turbo Machine Demon to guard around this place.  Now with Golden Star Tao Guo's failure, the Spider Catacomb is getting start to split, the Super Battle Spider is feeling this and about to come out soon.  You can enter Spider Catacomb from Screw Bay Jail.
